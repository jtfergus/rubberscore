# RubberScore

RubberScore is a friendly scorekeeper for rubber bridge or one continuous session of play. 

It’s built for mixed‑skill groups who want to stay in the flow, keep the table social, and wrap up with a clear recap.

### Two ways to play:
- **Rubber** — traditional rubber bridge scoring  
- **One Session** — casual, continuous play with no rubber prompts

### Why it’s different
- Fast hand entry and easy corrections
- Quick access to names, partners, and hand history
- Clear session recap at the end
- All data stays on your device unless you choose to export
